# Database-Design-for-Retail-Store-Chain
Database for retail store: Customers interact with employees, creating orders linked to products and payment info. Employees manage tasks, update product catalog. Managers coordinate. Suppliers add products. Employee IT access based on role.


As part of our ongoing commitment to ensure operational efficiency, transparency, and compliance with best practices, our company will be undergoing an internal audit in the coming weeks. In preparation for this, we need a detailed analysis of our sales, product, and customer data. This analysis will help us to not only assess our current operational practices but also to identify areas of improvement and ensure that we continue to meet the expectations of our stakeholders.

Problem Statements to be Addressed:

1. Assess the performance of our employees in relation to the company average.
2. Understand our sales pattern, especially regarding product categories.
3. Evaluate customer purchase frequency and change in trends.
4. Identify any products that might be underperforming or are not being sold.
5. Review the sales performance from all the locations.


We want to have a strong Database Management System for our use case.
